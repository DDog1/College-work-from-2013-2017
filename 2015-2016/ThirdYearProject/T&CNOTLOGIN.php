    </p>
    <p>
        Just as Boombastics requires users of our Site to respect our copyrights and those of our affiliates, licensors and business partners, we respect the
        copyrights of others. To that end, we have adopted this Copyright Policy in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (&#8220;Copyright
        Act&#8221;) (17 U.S.C. 512 et seq.).

        &#8211; whose name and contact information is noted below &#8211; receives proper notice of the alleged infringement, or if Boombastics otherwise comes to

        notification, a representative list of all those works on the Site;
    </p>
    <p>
        3. Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which
        is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate the material;

        4. Your contact information, including address, telephone number, and, if available, email address;
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
        6. Supplying a Counter-Notice Regarding Alleged Copyright Infringement
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are the provider of the Disputed Content and believe a copyright infringement notice has been wrongly submitted against you as a result of mistake
        or a misidentification of the claimed copyrighted material, you may send a counter-notification to our Designated Agent (whose address is included above).
        The counter notification must provide the following information:
    </p>
    <p>
        1. Physical or electronic signature of the subscriber;
    </p>
    <p>
        2. Identification of the Disputed Content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled, and the location where the Disputed Content appeared
        before it was removed or access to it was disabled;
    </p>
    <p>
        3. A statement under penalty of perjury that you believe in good faith that the Disputed Content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or
        misidentification;
    </p>
    <p>
        4. Your name, address, telephone number and, if available, email address; and
    </p>
    <p>
        5. A statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the judicial district pertaining to your address, or if your
        address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which BOOMBASTICS is located, and that you will accept service of process from the
        person who provided notification or an agent of such person.
    </p>
    <p>
        If our Designated Agent receives a counter-notice from you, Boombastics will send a copy of it to the original complaining party informing that person or
        entity that Boombastics may replace the removed Disputed Content or cease disabling access to it. Please note that when we forward the counter-notice, it
        includes your personal information. By submitting a counter-notice, you consent to having your information revealed in this way. We will not forward the
        counter-notice to any party other than the complaining party.
    </p>
    <p>
        Unless the Designated Agent receives notice from the original complaining party that the original complaining party has filed an action seeking a court
        order to restrain the user who posted the Disputed Content from engaging in infringing activity relating to the Disputed Content on the Site, Boombastics
        will replace or restore access to the Disputed Content on the Site or permit the user to re-post the Disputed Content.
