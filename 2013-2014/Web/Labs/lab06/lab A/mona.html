		<h1>Museum Of New and Old art (Mona)</h1>
		<h2>Background</h2>
		<p>
		Hobart hosts an internationally renowned new museum of art, <strong>'Mona'</strong> the <em>Museum of Old and New Art </em>. It is often favourably compared to the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, in that it is a major international tourist attraction located in a small city. Mona opened in 2011, the result of a multi-million redevelopment of the previous Moorilla Museum of Antiquities.
		</p>

		<p>
			As well as traditional 2D paintings and 3D sculptures, many of the exhibitions involved multimedia systems, such as video and animation systems, or fully interactive electronic ‘installations’
		</p>


		<h2>The O</h2>

		<img src="images/the_o_small.png" alt="the O device">
		<p>
			Mona developed an innovative mobile app, named ‘The O’, that is provided to each visitor on a iPod with headphones
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
			This app allows users to search for information about nearby exhibits (the devices uses wireless technology to monitor the visitors location in the museum)
			</li>

			<li>
			Visitors paths through the museum are recorded, allowing visitors to retrieve they routes from the web at a later date (if they provided an email address), and also providing useful traffic date for museum staff, in terms of visitor behaviour while in the museum
			</li>
		</ul>
